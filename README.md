# TripTracker

The TripTracker App is a web application developed using React.js and Leaflet that allows users to log their travel experiences by clicking on cities on a map. Users can log in to the app, click on a city on the map, and fill out a form with their travel details. After submitting the form, the selected city is added to the visited city's list, and users can also remove cities from their list.

## Features

- Interactive Map: The app uses the Leaflet library to display an interactive map where users can click on cities they have visited.
- User Authentication: Users can log in to the app, allowing them to save and access their travel data.
- City Logging: After clicking on a city on the map, users can fill out a form with information about their visit, such as the date and a note. The submitted information is saved as a travel log.
- Visited City List: A list of visited cities is displayed, showing the cities logged by the user. Users can view their previous travel logs and remove cities from the list if needed.
